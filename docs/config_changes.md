# Configuration and operations changes

Dated notes on changes to how the project is run (workflow, schedule, data sources, dependencies). Strategy
changes are not made here; the frozen design is recorded in `v1.0_freeze.md`.

Configuration changes to the paper-trading set-up. These are not trials: they do not change any signal, rule,
parameter or result of a frozen strategy, and they do not get a row in `trials.csv`.

| # | date recorded | effective from | change | reason | effect on frozen results |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C01 | 2026-11-03 | the 3 December 2026 rebalance | Paper capital raised from US$100,000 to US$10,000,000. | Contract-size granularity for the planned commodity futures: at US$100,000 the smallest tradeable position in a standard futures contract is a large fraction of capital, so positions could not be sized to the model's weights. | None. v1.0 sizes positions by weights (per cent of capital), and all of its performance is reported in percentages, so its frozen results (`results/systematic/test/`, `docs/v1.0_freeze.md`) are unaffected. |

## C01 — paper capital US$100,000 → US$10,000,000

- **What changes:** the notional capital against which paper positions are expressed in currency units. From the
  3 December 2026 rebalance, paper positions are sized against US$10,000,000 instead of US$100,000.
- **What does not change:** v1.0's frozen design (`results/systematic/fit/frozen_design.json`), its code
  (`em_macro/systematic.py`), its signals, sizing rule, volatility target, leverage cap, no-trade band and cost
  model. `results/systematic/positions.csv` sizes positions in per cent of capital and `results/systematic/paper_pnl.csv`
  records returns in decimal fractions; neither file depends on the capital level.
- **Reporting convention:** all performance, in every period (design 2005–2019, test 2020-01..2026-09, live paper
  trading from October 2026), is reported in percentages of capital. A change in the capital level therefore
  changes no reported figure.
- **Classification:** configuration change, not a trial. It is not counted in N (the multiple-testing trial count in
  `trials.csv`) and does not open a new trial group.
- **Live paper record:** the October and November 2026 paper months are on the US$100,000 basis; December 2026
  onward on the US$10,000,000 basis. Because both are reported in percentages, the series is continuous.

## 2026-11-04: November 2026 rebalance ran late

- **Scheduled:** 3 Nov 2026, 07:23 UTC (the monthly `systematic-monthly` workflow; positions as of Oct 2026,
  effective Nov 2026).
- **Actual run:** 4 Nov 2026, 04:06 to 04:09 UTC, one day late
  ([run 4](https://github.com/EthanC100/em-macro/actions/runs/41771158747), a manual run of the workflow on
  branch `claude/refresh-external-downloads-js0m77` after the fixes below; commit `bd236f9`, "Monthly systematic
  update 2026-11-04"). `results/systematic/rebalance_log.csv` records it as `scheduled_date 2026-11-03,
  run_date 2026-11-04, LATE by 1 day`, and `positions.csv` carries the same two dates. Later rebalances are
  logged there the same way.
- **What went wrong, in order:**
  1. 3 Nov, scheduled run: the data refresh stopped when mindicador.cl (Chile dollar series) answered HTTP 502
     after four tries over 30 seconds.
  2. 4 Nov, re-run of the same workflow: the refresh succeeded but the overlay step stopped on
     `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` (`pyyaml` was missing from `requirements.txt`).
  3. 4 Nov, first run of the fixed branch: BCB's SGS API answered 200 with a non-JSON body, which the downloader
     accepted. This opened alert issue #4 automatically.
  4. 4 Nov, second run of the fixed branch: api.imf.org answered 401 for a few minutes on one of the 91 WEO
     requests. The alert step commented on issue #4.
  5. 4 Nov, third run: succeeded; the workflow closed issue #4.
- **Fixes:** retries with backoff for connection errors, timeouts, 401/403/429, 5xx and bodies that fail a
  check; a per-host limit so a source that is down costs about a minute; a stale-copy fallback (raw downloads
  kept in the Actions cache, kept alive twice a week, and the IMF WEO files committed); `EM_MACRO_REFRESH=1` on
  the refresh step so every loader re-downloads first; `pyyaml` added; the hash test no longer pins files the
  workflow rewrites; the failure alert issue; the rebalance log. Details in `v1.0_freeze.md`, "Logged
  infrastructure fixes".

**2026-11-04, live-record start rule:** the v1.0 live record starts with the November 2026 rebalance (first rebalance after the 3 Nov 2026 freeze, positions effective 2026-11), so the Ledger counts live months, live Sharpe, live drawdown and track-record progress from 2026-11 only; October 2026 (after the 2020-01 to 2026-09 test, before the freeze) is a pre-live gap month, shown on charts as "pre-live (not counted)" and excluded from the live and backtest statistics (`LIVE_START_MONTH` in `ledger/build.py`).
